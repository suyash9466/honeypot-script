A. Change Hardcoded Paths
CONFIG = {
    'geoip_path': r'C:\xampp\geoip\GeoLite2-City.mmdb',
    'admin_db_path': r'C:\xampp\logs\admin_attacks.db',
    'log_dir': r'C:\xampp\logs\admin',
    'admin_block_threshold': 2 
}
What to change:

Update these paths based on where you place files in your system (Linux, XAMPP folder, etc.)
Summary for Others (Add in README or Docs)
If you are using this project:

1. Set your paths in CONFIG correctly

2. Create a fake admin page that sends login attempts to honeypot.py

3. Make sure Python has permission to modify firewall (run as Admin)

4. Install dependencies via pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Download and place GeoLite2-City.mmdb properly

6. That's it â€“ attacker IPs will be logged and blocked automatically!
